        <p><b>Computer programming is the process of designing and building an executable computer program to accomplish a <br>
                specific computing result or to perform a specific task. Programming involves tasks such as: analysis, generating <br>
                algorithms, profiling algorithms' accuracy and resource consumption, and the implementation of algorithms in a <br>
                chosen programming language (commonly referred to as coding).[1][2] The source code of a program is written in <br>
                one or more languages that are intelligible to programmers, rather than machine code, which is directly executed <br>
                by the central processing unit. The purpose of programming is to find a sequence of instructions that will automate <br>
                the performance of a task (which can be as complex as an operating system) on a computer, often for solving a given <br>
                problem. Proficient programming thus often requires expertise in several different subjects, including knowledge of <br>
                the application domain, specialized algorithms, and formal logic.<br>

                Tasks accompanying and related to programming include: testing, debugging, source code maintenance, implementation <br>
                of build systems, and management of derived artifacts, such as the machine code of computer programs. These might be <br>
                considered part of the programming process, but often the term software development is used for this larger process <br>
                with the term programming, implementation, or coding reserved for the actual writing of code. Software engineering <br>
                combines engineering techniques with software development practices. Reverse engineering is the opposite process. A <br>
                hacker is any skilled computer expert that uses their technical knowledge to overcome a problem, but it can also <br>
                mean a security hacker in common language.</b></p>

        <h1>Herobrine</h1>
        <p><b>Herobrine has been the pinnacle of legends and scary stories for over a decade, but despite being a significant figure in Minecraft, not much, aside from his origin, is known about him.

The first sighting of Herobrine dates back to 2010. This sighting came in the form of an image detailing the encounter, which was posted on 4chan's /v/ board. The legend began to spiral from there; spawning streams, hoaxes, easter eggs, mods, texture packs, and so much more.

The friendly and familiar Minecraft Steve skin takes on a new sense of malice with Herobrine's hollow, white eyes. He watches players from afar; hiding in the fog of their low render distance, stalking, and hunting. His purpose in the game is unknown, but there's no way his cold white eyes look on with good intentions.

In no particular order, here are some facts that could help players looking to deepen their knowledge on the legend of Herobrine.

            <p><b>The legend of Herobrine began with the above picture, and despite this image's infamy it wasn't until nearly a decade after the deletion of the original post that the world seed of this exact sighting was found.

The project to find the original seed was started on September 5th, 2020.

On January 16th, 2021 andrew_555 (Kminster) discovered the original Herobrine world seed at around 12:12 AM UTC (8:12 AM EST).

The seed is: 478868574082066804

Players must be on version Java Alpha 1.0.16_02 to experience the full immersion from the original picture (as this is the version of Minecraft before the hunger bar). But, of course, it's accessible from the current version of Minecraft too.
